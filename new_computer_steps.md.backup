## Add Julia
* Download: https://julialang.org/downloads/, e.g. the latest 64-bit glibc version
* Extract. 
* Then browse into the extracted folder to find the folder containing the content like the bin folder etc. Copy/cut all content and move to a local folder where you want Julia to exist e.g. `/home/kevin/julia/`. Not have the version tag in this folder name, so plain `julia` rather than `julia-1.8.5` means the symbolic links can stay constant when you upgrade julia in the future.

sudo ln -s /home/kevin/julia/bin/julia /usr/bin/julia
